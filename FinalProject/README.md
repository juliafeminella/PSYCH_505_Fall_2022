> This experiment is a short task about the Uncanny Valley. The general idea for the design was based on a paper by Mathur and Reichling (2016; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2015.09.008). All the images were taken from the publicly available dataset provided by the authors: https://osf.io/3rjnk/

> In this experiment, the participant has to make a subjective rating on how likeable a robot face seems. The uncanny valley proposition generally states that robots that look more similar to humans are bound to be more likeable, but only until a certain degree. By pressing a number from 1 to 5, the participant indicates their response in a continuum from 1 = disturbing to 5 = likeable. A fixation cross is presented for .5 seconds before the presentation of each face, The experiment will only continue once the participant presses a key. To determine how intuitive this judgement is, we are also collecting the reaction time for each response.
