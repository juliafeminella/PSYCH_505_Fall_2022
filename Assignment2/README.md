#Divide 5/2 (integer format) and 5.0/2.0 (float format). Does python output the same values for these? (You might get a different answer depending on the version of python you are in). If you got a different answer for the two operations, explain why.
print(5/2)
print(5.0/2.0)
# There was no difference between the operations

print (7 % 2)
print(10 % 2)
print (235 % 4)

#It gives us the remainder of the division of the first number by the second

print (8 ** 2)
print (10 ** 5)

#It exponentiates the first number to the power of the second

print (40 // 3)
print (35 // 8)

#It gives us the result of the division as a whole number, disconsidering the remainder

print(6 + 10 + 9 * 9 / 8)
print(5 + 1 + 1 * 2 / 3)
print(1 + 2 * 5 /2)

#Python does follow the order for operations

#Boolean exercises
print(1 == 1.0)
print("1" == "1.0")

#The frist statement is true because, despite being an interger and a float, the value is the same.
#The second statement is false because by putting the paretheses, we are teliing Pythin that's a string, or text, which does not have a numerical value assigned to it

print(5 == 3+2)
#They are equivalent becuse the operation results in the same value
